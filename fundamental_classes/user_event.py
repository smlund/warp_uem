    The init method captures what happens when instance = UserEvent()
    is called.  Specifically, this allows us to store and then

      self: The UserEvent object --- standard notation
        for object oriented python.
      callback: The function to that will be called when
        UserEvent.callFunction is called.
      arg: An ordered list of argument in the order they
        should be passed to the callback function.
      additional_attributes: A dict containing the names (string)
        and values of additional attributes to be set.  These
        attributes will not be passed to the callback.  Instead,
        this provides a hook to providing logic during 
        a captured callFunction method.
